# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using several machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on diagnostic data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. In this project, we applied various supervised machine learning algorithms and achieved our highest accuracy using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with **97% accuracy**.

## 📊 Algorithms Applied

We experimented with the following machine learning models:

- 🧮 **Decision Tree (DT)**
- 🔗 **Logistic Regression (LG)**
- 📐 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ✅ *(Best Accuracy: 97%)*
- 🎯 **Naive Bayes (NB)**
- 🌲 **Random Forest (RF)**

## 📌 Results Summary

| Model              | Accuracy (%) |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree      | ~92%         |
| Logistic Regression| ~95%         |
| **SVM**            | **97%** ✅   |
| Naive Bayes        | ~93%         |
| Random Forest      | ~94%         |
